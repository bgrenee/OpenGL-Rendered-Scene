# 7-1_FinalProjectMilestones

My scene has a few objects. This scene is right on my nightstand which is next to my 
desk. So, it is very helpful for working on the project. I took photos just in case but, I had a real 
time reference to work with. There are a few objects in my scene. I have a candle warmer, an 
upright book, two pencils (one with an eraser top), and a photo on the wall. For the candle 
warmer â€“ I broke this object into two parts which were made up of two cylinders. With one 
cylinder smaller than the other and stacked on top. The book was made from two boxes that were 
elongated to make a rectangle and then planes for the book cover. There was probably a better 
way to build this, but this is how I went about it. Next, I have my photo on the wall which was a 
simple plane with a texture. Lastly, I have two pencils. Both are structured the same, minus the 
eraser for one of the pencils. The pencils have a cylinder base, and a cone tip. The erasers are 
made of another cylinder and then a prism for the eraser top. All of these shapes/meshes is what 
created the scene that is in my project.

Users can navigate the scene 
with the mouse and keyboard. Just 
like a game, users can go forward 
and backward or left and right with 
WASD. To go either up or down we 
implemented the Q and E key to 
navigate these directions. We also 
wanted to speed up the camera by using the scroll wheel. Minus navigation, we also 
implemented O and P to switch between orthographic and perspective. Both functions used 
callbacks to process the keys or mouse buttons.

A lot of the code used in this project is to be reused. We reused the same code for the 
keyboard callbacks, but we changed the buttons that were connected to the callback. Same with 
the lighting, I would reuse this code and then tweak the RBG, positions, and scaling for the 
lighting. This made the project go by fast since everything we were adding to the project was just 
repeated but with slights changed in their transitions.
