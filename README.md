# OpenGL Rendered Scene

My scene has a few objects. This scene is right on my nightstand which is next to my 
desk. So, it is very helpful for working on the project. I took photos just in case but, I had a real 
time reference to work with. There are a few objects in my scene. I have a candle warmer, an 
upright book, two pencils (one with an eraser top), and a photo on the wall. For the candle 
warmer – I broke this object into two parts which were made up of two cylinders. With one 
cylinder smaller than the other and stacked on top. The book was made from two boxes that were 
elongated to make a rectangle and then planes for the book cover. There was probably a better 
way to build this, but this is how I went about it. Next, I have my photo on the wall which was a 
simple plane with a texture. Lastly, I have two pencils. Both are structured the same, minus the 
eraser for one of the pencils. The pencils have a cylinder base, and a cone tip. The erasers are 
made of another cylinder and then a prism for the eraser top. All of these shapes/meshes is what 
created the scene that is in my project.

Users can navigate the scene 
with the mouse and keyboard. Just 
like a game, users can go forward 
and backward or left and right with 
WASD. To go either up or down we 
implemented the Q and E key to 
navigate these directions. We also 
wanted to speed up the camera by using the scroll wheel. Minus navigation, we also 
implemented O and P to switch between orthographic and perspective. Both functions used 
callbacks to process the keys or mouse buttons.

A lot of the code used in this project is to be reused. We reused the same code for the 
keyboard callbacks, but we changed the buttons that were connected to the callback. Same with 
the lighting, I would reuse this code and then tweak the RBG, positions, and scaling for the 
lighting. This made the project go by fast since everything we were adding to the project was just 
repeated but with slights changed in their transitions.

I learned a lot about OpenGl and what it has to offer. It really made me appreciate how easy (well "easy") blender is and how fast creating 3D is when you have all the tools given to you. My design process was to break down all my objects into what made sense to me. Small shapes that also followed some rules for when I needed to put my materials and textures on. I made a sketch of what shapes were needed, what textures were needed for specific objects, and how light would interact with the objects and interact with each other. One tactical strategy I plant to apply to future work is to have a cheat-sheet of lighting for types of textures and materials. For me, lighting was the hardest part of the project.
When I develop programs, I do as much research as possible. If I am building something that requires me to know at least the basics of 5 other things. I will spend the day understanding it to the best of my ability. Then I will move to planning a mini map of what the program is and what the goal of this program should be. I try my best to break it down into smaller chunks so that I am not overwhelmed and the best way to be overwhelmed is being unorganized. I didn’t really use any new development strategies when working on my 3D project and I understood the work and graded well so I think I’ve done well with the strategies I have accomplished so far in terms of my learning. Since the code for the OpenGl project was minimal, I would say developing code was not very complex. When you understood what you needed for one part, you would reuse that code for other parts of the project which made it simple. So, if you understand the code and what the code is doing, you can apply that to other parts of the project and successfully complete the project. 
Before starting this class, I was not really excited about the lack of a project that fit what I want to do. I love art, and it used to be my career but, I really focus on cybersecurity projects. However, this project was very helpful. I’m not the best at coding and even though the code was very simple, I did help me to brush up on it a lot. Not even just code. I don’t see myself ever using OpenGl unless I randomly choose to go down a path that needs visualization though, I am grateful to have gotten to know what it is, how powerful it is, and what it can do. It has been a great class for me as a student in Computer Science.
