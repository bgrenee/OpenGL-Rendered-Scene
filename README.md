# 7-1_FinalProjectMilestones

My scene has a few objects. This scene is right on my nightstand which is next to my 
desk. So, it is very helpful for working on the project. I took photos just in case but, I had a real 
time reference to work with. There are a few objects in my scene. I have a candle warmer, an 
upright book, two pencils (one with an eraser top), and a photo on the wall. For the candle 
warmer â€“ I broke this object into two parts which were made up of two cylinders. With one 
cylinder smaller than the other and stacked on top. The book was made from two boxes that were 
elongated to make a rectangle and then planes for the book cover. There was probably a better 
way to build this, but this is how I went about it. Next, I have my photo on the wall which was a 
simple plane with a texture. Lastly, I have two pencils. Both are structured the same, minus the 
eraser for one of the pencils. The pencils have a cylinder base, and a cone tip. The erasers are 
made of another cylinder and then a prism for the eraser top. All of these shapes/meshes is what 
created the scene that is in my project.
